# First weeks

- refresh django
- create a 100 days of code challenge tracker
- make it reachable through github

## Day 2

- changed bootstrap template
- added views
- added about me
- completed skeleton for project

## Day 3

- added admin
- created superuser
- fixed layer 8 lists
- added first test commit which was displayed succesfully (crud pending for tomorrow)
- fixed templates/heritage (missing a couple)

## Day 4

- Created detailed view
- investigating pulling information from github. sources:
  - <https://www.section.io/engineering-education/working-with-github-web-api-in-python/>
  - <https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub>
  - <https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>
  - <https://towardsdatascience.com/all-the-things-you-can-do-with-github-api-and-python-f01790fca131>
  - <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/commits#list-commits>
- reached a conclusion: rather than using the pygithub library, i have to use requests to fully use the API

## Day 5

- I'm seeing master branch commits url and dates; now i need to see other branches' commits

## Day 6

- continue debugging the getting info from branches
- view how to show the information gathered from a function on the django app
- re-learned about MRO and super function

## Day 7

- trying to get the function to show stuff on the template does not seem to be so easy unless info comes from the db (model)
- going back to youtube 13 hours course on django...
